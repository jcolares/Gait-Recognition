# Gait-Recognition

This repository is for a Minor Project which I will be starting soon based on Silhouette analysis-based gait recognition for human identification. I will be focusing mainly on the cross-view gait recognition system.

Coding will be done in Python
Dataset to be used will be OU-ISIR Dataset
